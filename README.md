# Stylemaker-App
This project is an Android project, it is written in Android Studio. In the project, there are different users, all users have 
their own passwords and user names. I check all of the users before logging in(whther they have registered correctly or not).
After registering the app, users can choose different type of clothes for themselves. They can choose
different pants, shirts and shoes and they can see their choosings over on the top of the other in a different page. The pants, shirts
and shoes are supplied by the database which I created. After loging in the app, users can see the clothes which are in database. By this 
way, they can combine different brands over on the top of the other. I hope it will be helpful for users.
